# Twitter Terrorism Research

This repository contains research on Twitter's response to terrorist attacks.
It includes a set of Jupyter notebooks that analyze activities before and after several terrorist attacks in western countries.
The notebooks directory contains ipython_ICWSM16.ipynb, which has analyzes Twitter data from the Boston Marathon bombing, Sydney Cafe Hostage Crisis, and Paris Charlie Hebdo attacks.
This notebook is the basis of the work by Buntain et al. published at ICWSM 2016 [1].

Two more notebooks are provided (toree_ParisNovemberAttacks.ipynb and toree_BrusselsAttacks.ipynb) that leverage [Apache Toree](https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree), [bokeh-scala](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh-scala), and [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) to perform similar analyses at scale.
